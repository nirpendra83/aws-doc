## AWS Account and Infrastructure Overview <a id="aws-account-and-infrastructure-overview"></a>

Learn about the basic building blocks of the AWS ecosystem.

### AWS Account

- Your **AWS Account** is your unique identity in AWS, managing your resources, billing, and permissions.
- Supports multiple users through **IAM**.
- Can be grouped into **Organizations** to manage multiple accounts.

### AWS Regions

- Geographically isolated locations designed for fault tolerance and low latency.
- Examples: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `eu-west-1` (Ireland), `ap-south-1` (Mumbai).

### Availability Zones (AZs)

- Physically separate data centers within a region.
- Connected with low-latency links for high availability.
- Distribute resources across AZs to increase fault tolerance.

### Edge Locations

- Part of AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Cache and deliver content globally via **Amazon CloudFront**.
- Reduce latency and improve user experience.
