Managing multiple AWS accounts is a best practice for organizations looking to improve security, billing, and resource isolation. The **AWS Multi-Account Strategy** helps you organize your cloud environment efficiently.

## Legacy Approach: Single AWS Account

Before multi-account strategies became popular, many organizations used a **single AWS account** for all workloads, environments, and teams.

### Challenges of the Legacy Approach:

- **Security risks:** Lack of isolation increases blast radius if credentials are compromised.
- **Billing confusion:** Difficult to track costs per project, environment, or team.
- **Resource limits:** AWS service quotas apply per account, limiting scalability.
- **Complex permissions:** Managing IAM policies for diverse teams and environments becomes complicated.
- **Operational risks:** Accidental resource changes can impact production workloads.

---

## Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts?

- **Isolation of workloads:** Separate development, testing, and production environments.
- **Security boundaries:** Limit blast radius if one account is compromised.
- **Billing clarity:** Track costs by team, project, or environment.
- **Simplified compliance:** Enforce policies and audits more easily.
- **Resource limits:** Avoid hitting AWS service limits by distributing resources across accounts.

## Key Components of a Multi-Account Strategy

### AWS Organizations

- Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts.
- Use **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to set permission guardrails.
- Consolidated billing for all linked accounts.
- Automated account creation and lifecycle management.

### Account Structure Models

#### 1. Environment-Based

| Account Name | Purpose           |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Prod         | Production workloads |
| Dev          | Development environment |
| Test         | Testing and QA       |

#### 2. Business Unit-Based

| Account Name | Purpose            |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Marketing    | Marketing projects  |
| Finance     | Financial systems    |
| Engineering | Engineering projects |

#### 3. Application-Based

| Account Name | Purpose            |
|--------------|--------------------|
| App-A        | Application A workloads |
| App-B        | Application B workloads |

## Best Practices

- **Centralize logging and monitoring:** Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config aggregated in a dedicated account.
- **Use cross-account roles:** Enable secure access between accounts.
- **Automate account provisioning:** Use AWS Control Tower or custom automation.
- **Implement guardrails:** Apply SCPs to enforce security policies.
- **Tag consistently:** Use tags for cost allocation and resource management.

## Summary

A well-planned multi-account strategy enhances security, operational efficiency, and cost control in AWS environments. AWS Organizations and related tools make managing multiple accounts easier and more secure.
