### ðŸ“š AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.

---

## âœ… **What is AWS IAM?**

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to:

- **Manage users and their permissions** to access AWS resources.
- **Grant fine-grained access** using policies.
- **Enhance security** by applying best practices like least privilege and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Control authentication and authorization** across accounts and services.

---

## âœ… **Key Components of IAM**

### 1. **Users**
- Represents individual people or services accessing AWS.
- Each user can have their own credentials (password, access keys).

### 2. **Groups**
- A collection of IAM users.
- Apply permissions collectively rather than individually.

### 3. **Roles**
- Assign permissions to AWS resources without creating long-term credentials.
- Used by applications, services, or federated users.

### 4. **Policies**
- JSON documents that define permissions.
- Specify allowed or denied actions, resources, and conditions.

---

## âœ… **IAM Policies**

### Example of a simple policy:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
        }
    ]
}
```

### âœ… 10 Tasks Related to AWS IAM Users

These tasks are commonly performed when managing IAM Users in AWS.

---

### 1. **Create a new IAM user**
- Add a user with a name and specify programmatic or console access.

### 2. **Assign permissions to a user**
- Attach managed or inline policies to grant necessary permissions.

### 3. **Add a user to a group**
- Place users into groups to inherit shared permissions.

### 4. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Secure the userâ€™s AWS account by enabling MFA.

### 5. **Generate access keys for the user**
- Create programmatic access credentials for CLI or SDK use.

### 6. **Rotate the userâ€™s access keys**
- Replace old keys with new ones to enhance security.

### 7. **Set password policies**
- Enforce password length, complexity, and expiration rules for users.

### 8. **Attach policies using least privilege principle**
- Grant only required permissions rather than full access.

### 9. **Monitor user activity**
- Use AWS CloudTrail or IAM Access Analyzer to review actions performed by users.

### 10. **Remove unused or inactive users**
- Identify and delete users that are no longer required or inactive.


## AWS Multi-Account Strategy

Managing multiple AWS accounts is a best practice for organizations looking to improve security, billing, and resource isolation. The **AWS Multi-Account Strategy** helps you organize your cloud environment efficiently.

---

## Legacy Approach: Single AWS Account

Before multi-account strategies became popular, many organizations used a **single AWS account** for all workloads, environments, and teams.

### Challenges of the Legacy Approach:

- **Security risks:** Lack of isolation increases blast radius if credentials are compromised.
- **Billing confusion:** Difficult to track costs per project, environment, or team.
- **Resource limits:** AWS service quotas apply per account, limiting scalability.
- **Complex permissions:** Managing IAM policies for diverse teams and environments becomes complicated.
- **Operational risks:** Accidental resource changes can impact production workloads.

---

## Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts?

- **Isolation of workloads:** Separate development, testing, and production environments.
- **Security boundaries:** Limit blast radius if one account is compromised.
- **Billing clarity:** Track costs by team, project, or environment.
- **Simplified compliance:** Enforce policies and audits more easily.
- **Resource limits:** Avoid hitting AWS service limits by distributing resources across accounts.

---

## Key Components of a Multi-Account Strategy

### AWS Organizations

- Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts.
- Use **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to set permission guardrails.
- Consolidated billing for all linked accounts.
- Automated account creation and lifecycle management.

### Account Structure Models

#### 1. Environment-Based

| Account Name | Purpose           |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Prod         | Production workloads |
| Dev          | Development environment |
| Test         | Testing and QA       |

#### 2. Business Unit-Based

| Account Name | Purpose            |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Marketing    | Marketing projects  |
| Finance     | Financial systems    |
| Engineering | Engineering projects |

#### 3. Application-Based

| Account Name | Purpose            |
|--------------|--------------------|
| App-A        | Application A workloads |
| App-B        | Application B workloads |

---

## Best Practices

- **Centralize logging and monitoring:** Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config aggregated in a dedicated account.
- **Use cross-account roles:** Enable secure access between accounts.
- **Automate account provisioning:** Use AWS Control Tower or custom automation.
- **Implement guardrails:** Apply SCPs to enforce security policies.
- **Tag consistently:** Use tags for cost allocation and resource management.

AWS Organizations

â”œâ”€â”€ Security Account (centralized logging, monitoring)
â”œâ”€â”€ Shared Services Account (DNS, directory services)
â”œâ”€â”€ Prod Account(s)
â”œâ”€â”€ Dev Account(s)
â””â”€â”€ Test Account(s)
```
## Key Points to Remember: AWS Multi-Account Architectures

For multi-AWS account architectures, you must be familiar with **cross-account AWS service-specific configurations** and services that enable organizations to maintain centralized access.

| Services / Configurations    | Descriptions                                                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Organizations**        | Centralized account management, policy enforcement, consolidated billing |
| **IAM Identity Center**      | Centralized user authentication and access management          |
| **AWS Security Hub**         | Centralized security posture management                         |
| **Cross-Account Configurations** | CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, CloudWatch                      |

These services and configurations help enforce security, manage access, and centralize monitoring across multiple AWS accounts.
