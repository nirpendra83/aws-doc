It is based on five pillars:\n1. Operational Excellence Focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continuously improve processes and procedures.\nKey Topics:\nPerform operations as code Make frequent, small, reversible changes Refine operations procedures frequently Anticipate failure Learn from all operational failures 2. Security Protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.\nKey Topics:\nImplement strong identity foundation Enable traceability Apply security at all layers Automate security best practices Protect data in transit and at rest Prepare for security events 3. Reliability Ensure a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when expected.\nKey Topics:\nAutomatically recover from failure Test recovery procedures Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability Manage change in automation 4. Performance Efficiency Use IT and computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintain efficiency as demand changes.\nKey Topics:\nDemocratize advanced technologies Go global in minutes Use serverless architectures Experiment more often Monitor performance and make trade-offs 5. Cost Optimization Avoid unnecessary costs by selecting the right resource types and sizes, and scaling to meet actual needs without overspending.\nKey Topics:\nAdopt a consumption model Measure overall efficiency Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting Analyze and attribute expenditure Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership Summary The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach to evaluate architectures and implement designs that will scale over time. Itâ€™s essential for building resilient and efficient applications on AWS.\nFor more details, visit the AWS Well-Architected Framework official page.\nAssignments: Create your AWS Account Walkthrough AWS console Revist Ec2 instances Create an instance perform various actions on AWS Ec2 Instances.

    "content": "ðŸ“š AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.\nâœ… What is AWS IAM? AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to:\nManage users and their permissions to access AWS resources. Grant fine-grained access using policies. Enhance security by applying best practices like least privilege and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Control authentication and authorization across accounts and services. âœ… Key Components of IAM 1. Users Represents individual people or services accessing AWS. Each user can have their own credentials (password, access keys). 2. Groups A collection of IAM users. Apply permissions collectively rather than individually. 3. Roles Assign permissions to AWS resources without creating long-term credentials. Used by applications, services, or federated users. 4. Policies JSON documents that define permissions. Specify allowed or denied actions, resources, and conditions. âœ… IAM Policies Example of a simple policy: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:ListBucket\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket\" } ] }\rAssignmnets: âœ… 10 Tasks Related to AWS IAM Users These tasks are commonly performed when managing IAM Users in AWS.\n1. Create a new IAM user Add a user with a name and specify programmatic or console access. 2. Assign permissions to a user Attach managed or inline policies to grant necessary permissions. 3. Add a user to a group Place users into groups to inherit shared permissions. 4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Secure the userâ€™s AWS account by enabling MFA. 5. Generate access keys for the user Create programmatic access credentials for CLI or SDK use. 6. Rotate the userâ€™s access keys Replace old keys with new ones to enhance security. 7. Set password policies Enforce password length, complexity, and expiration rules for users. 8. Attach policies using least privilege principle Grant only required permissions rather than full access. 9. Monitor user activity Use AWS CloudTrail or IAM Access Analyzer to review actions performed by users. 10. Remove unused or inactive users Identify and delete users that are no longer required or inactive. AWS Multi-Account Strategy Managing multiple AWS accounts is a best practice for organizations looking to improve security, billing, and resource isolation. The AWS Multi-Account Strategy helps you organize your cloud environment efficiently.\nLegacy Approach: Single AWS Account Before multi-account strategies became popular, many organizations used a single AWS account for all workloads, environments, and teams.\nChallenges of the Legacy Approach: Security risks: Lack of isolation increases blast radius if credentials are compromised. Billing confusion: Difficult to track costs per project, environment, or team. Resource limits: AWS service quotas apply per account, limiting scalability. Complex permissions: Managing IAM policies for diverse teams and environments becomes complicated. Operational risks: Accidental resource changes can impact production workloads. Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts? Isolation of workloads: Separate development, testing, and production environments. Security boundaries: Limit blast radius if one account is compromised. Billing clarity: Track costs by team, project, or environment. Simplified compliance: Enforce policies and audits more easily. Resource limits: Avoid hitting AWS service limits by distributing resources across accounts. Key Components of a Multi-Account Strategy AWS Organizations Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts. Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to set permission guardrails. Consolidated billing for all linked accounts. Automated account creation and lifecycle management. Account Structure Models 1. Environment-Based Account Name Purpose Prod Production workloads Dev Development environment Test Testing and QA 2. Business Unit-Based Account Name Purpose Marketing Marketing projects Finance Financial systems Engineering Engineering projects 3. Application-Based Account Name Purpose App-A Application A workloads App-B Application B workloads Best Practices Centralize logging and monitoring: Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config aggregated in a dedicated account. Use cross-account roles: Enable secure access between accounts. Automate account provisioning: Use AWS Control Tower or custom automation. Implement guardrails: Apply SCPs to enforce security policies. Tag consistently: Use tags for cost allocation and resource management. Visual Overview AWS Organizations â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Security Account (centralized logging, monitoring) â”œâ”€â”€ Shared Services Account (DNS, directory services) â”œâ”€â”€ Prod Account(s) â”œâ”€â”€ Dev Account(s) â””â”€â”€ Test Account(s)\rKey Points to Remember: AWS Multi-Account Architectures For multi-AWS account architectures, you must be familiar with cross-account AWS service-specific configurations and services that enable organizations to maintain centralized access.\nServices / Configurations Descriptions AWS Organizations Centralized account management, policy enforcement, consolidated billing IAM Identity Center Centralized user authentication and access management AWS Security Hub Centralized security posture management Cross-Account Configurations CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, CloudWatch These services and configurations help enforce security, manage access, and centralize monitoring across multiple AWS accounts.",
