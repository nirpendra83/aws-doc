    "content": "Objectives [Understand the fundamentals of AWS IAM and its components] Learn how to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions securely Implement best practices for access control and identity federation Configure permissions for services like EC2. üìö AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.\n‚úÖ What is AWS IAM? AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to:\nManage users and their permissions to access AWS resources. Grant fine-grained access using policies. Enhance security by applying best practices like least privilege and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Control authentication and authorization across accounts and services. ‚úÖ Key Components of IAM 1. Users Represents individual people or services accessing AWS. Each user can have their own credentials (password, access keys). 2. Groups A collection of IAM users. Apply permissions collectively rather than individually. 3. Roles Assign permissions to AWS resources without creating long-term credentials. Used by applications, services, or federated users. 4. Policies JSON documents that define permissions. Specify allowed or denied actions, resources, and conditions. ‚úÖ IAM Policies Example of a simple policy: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:ListBucket\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket\" } ] }\rManaging IAM Resources ‚úÖ Adding a User Navigate to the IAM console Click ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdd user‚Äù Enter username, select access type (programmatic or console) Attach existing policies or create custom ones Add user to groups if needed Review and create ‚úÖ Adding a Group Navigate to the IAM console Click ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate group‚Äù Enter group name Attach policies (managed or custom) Add users to the group Review and create ‚úÖ Attaching Policies to Users or Groups Use AWS Managed Policies or create Customer Managed Policies Assign permissions based on roles or business requirements Example: Attach AmazonEC2FullAccess to developers managing instances ‚úÖ Creating and Using Roles Navigate to ‚ÄúRoles‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate role‚Äù Select trusted entity type (AWS service, another account, or web identity) Attach permissions policies Review and create Assign role to EC2, Lambda, or external service ‚úÖ Test by Attaching the Role to an EC2 Instance Navigate to EC2 ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Launch Instance Configure the instance by selecting an AMI and instance type In Configure Instance Details, under IAM role, select the role you created Complete the rest of the instance setup and launch it Connect to the instance using SSH and verify the role is attached by running: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info or aws s3 ls\rAWS Multi-Account Strategy Managing multiple AWS accounts is a best practice for organizations looking to improve security, billing, and resource isolation. The AWS Multi-Account Strategy helps you organize your cloud environment efficiently.\nLegacy Approach: Single AWS Account Before multi-account strategies became popular, many organizations used a single AWS account for all workloads, environments, and teams.\nChallenges of the Legacy Approach: Security risks: Lack of isolation increases blast radius if credentials are compromised. Billing confusion: Difficult to track costs per project, environment, or team. Resource limits: AWS service quotas apply per account, limiting scalability. Complex permissions: Managing IAM policies for diverse teams and environments becomes complicated. Operational risks: Accidental resource changes can impact production workloads. Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts? Isolation of workloads: Separate development, testing, and production environments. Security boundaries: Limit blast radius if one account is compromised. Billing clarity: Track costs by team, project, or environment. Simplified compliance: Enforce policies and audits more easily. Resource limits: Avoid hitting AWS service limits by distributing resources across accounts. Key Components of a Multi-Account Strategy AWS Organizations Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts. Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to set permission guardrails. Consolidated billing for all linked accounts. Automated account creation and lifecycle management. Account Structure Models 1. Environment-Based Account Name Purpose Prod Production workloads Dev Development environment Test Testing and QA 2. Business Unit-Based Account Name Purpose Marketing Marketing projects Finance Financial systems Engineering Engineering projects 3. Application-Based Account Name Purpose App-A Application A workloads App-B Application B workloads Best Practices Centralize logging and monitoring: Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config aggregated in a dedicated account. Use cross-account roles: Enable secure access between accounts. Automate account provisioning: Use AWS Control Tower or custom automation. Implement guardrails: Apply SCPs to enforce security policies. Tag consistently: Use tags for cost allocation and resource management. Visual Overview AWS Organizations ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Account (centralized logging, monitoring) ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared Services Account (DNS, directory services) ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prod Account(s) ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev Account(s) ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Test Account(s)\rKey Points to Remember: AWS Multi-Account Architectures For multi-AWS account architectures, you must be familiar with cross-account AWS service-specific configurations and services that enable organizations to maintain centralized access.\nServices / Configurations Descriptions AWS Organizations Centralized account management, policy enforcement, consolidated billing IAM Identity Center Centralized user authentication and access management AWS Security Hub Centralized security posture management Cross-Account Configurations CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, CloudWatch These services and configurations help enforce security, manage access, and centralize monitoring across multiple AWS accounts.\n‚úÖ AWS IAM ‚Äì Assume Role üìå What is Assume Role? Assume Role is an AWS feature that allows a user, application, or service to temporarily acquire permissions defined by a role without needing permanent credentials.\nThis is useful for:\n‚úî Granting limited-time access to resources\n‚úî Cross-account access\n‚úî Secure access for applications running on AWS\n‚úî Federation with external identities\n‚úÖ Key Concepts ‚úÖ Role An IAM entity with permissions attached. Does not have its own long-term credentials like users. ‚úÖ Assume Role A process where an entity temporarily takes on the permissions of a role. Uses AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request temporary credentials. ‚úÖ Trust Policy Defines which entities are allowed to assume the role. ‚úÖ Session A temporary environment where permissions are valid. Credentials expire after a set time. ‚úÖ How Assume Role Works An entity (user, service, application) requests to assume a role. AWS verifies the request based on the trust policy. AWS issues temporary security credentials (access key, secret key, and session token). The entity uses these credentials to access AWS resources. ‚úÖ Example Trust Policy This policy allows the user Alice to assume the role:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] }\rLabs: ‚úÖ Creating and Using Roles Navigate IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create Role Select trusted entity type: AWS service, another account, or web identity Attach permissions policies based on role requirements Review and create the role Assign role to EC2, Lambda, or external service ‚úÖ Assuming a Role Use temporary credentials via STS to assume a role Example CLI command: aws sts assume-role \\ --role-arn \"arn:aws:iam::\u003caccount-id\u003e:role/\u003crole-name\u003e\" \\ --role-session-name \"SessionName\"\r‚úÖ Testing an Assumed Role from AWS Console Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your IAM user credentials.\nSwitch Role:\nClick on your username (top-right corner) ‚Üí Switch Role Enter the Account ID and Role Name of the role you want to assume Optionally, add a Display Name and Color for easier identification Click Switch Role Verify Role Permissions:\nOnce switched, you‚Äôll see the new role‚Äôs name in the console header Try accessing resources allowed by the role (e.g., list S3 buckets, launch EC2) If actions succeed, the role is working correctly If you see ‚ÄúAccess Denied,‚Äù the role‚Äôs permissions or trust policy may need adjustment Switch Back:\nClick on the role name (top-right) ‚Üí Back to your original user ‚úÖ AWS Organizations üìå What is AWS Organizations? AWS Organizations is a service that helps you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts.\nIt allows you to group accounts, apply policies, and simplify billing across your organization.\nKey benefits:\nCentralized management of multiple AWS accounts Apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) for governance Consolidated billing and cost tracking Simplified account creation and organization ‚úÖ Key Concepts 1. Organization The top-level entity that contains all your AWS accounts and OUs. 2. Accounts Individual AWS accounts within your organization. Can be master/management account or member accounts. 3. Organizational Units (OUs) Logical grouping of accounts within the organization. SCPs can be applied at the OU level for consistent governance. 4. Service Control Policies (SCPs) Policies that define what actions accounts in your organization can or cannot perform. SCPs restrict permissions, but do not grant them. 5. Master / Management Account The account that creates the organization and manages billing, OUs, and policies. ‚úÖ Features Account Management: Create, invite, and manage accounts from a single place. Centralized Billing: Consolidate billing for all accounts into a single payment method. Policy-Based Management: Apply SCPs to OUs and accounts to enforce governance. Automation: Use AWS Control Tower or CLI for managing multiple accounts. ‚úÖ Steps to Create an AWS Organization Step 1: Sign in as the Master Account Use the root account or IAM user with admin privileges. Step 2: Create the Organization Go to AWS Organizations console ‚Üí C ‚úÖ AWS SCP (Service Control Policies) üìå What is SCP? Service Control Policies (SCPs) are a feature of AWS Organizations that allow you to control what services and actions accounts in your organization can access.\nSCPs do not grant permissions; they only restrict or allow actions for accounts under an Organizational Unit (OU).\n‚úÖ Key Concepts Root: Top-level container in an AWS Organization. SCPs attached here apply to all accounts. Organizational Unit (OU): A container for accounts. SCPs attached to an OU apply to all member accounts. Policy types: Allow list: Only actions listed are allowed. Deny list: Actions listed are explicitly denied. Effect: Allow or Deny. Deny overrides any Allow permission from IAM policies. ‚úÖ Steps to Create and Attach SCP Step 1: Enable AWS Organizations Login as root user or account with permissions. Go to AWS Organizations console. Create an organization if not already done. Step 2: Create a Service Control Policy Go to Policies ‚Üí Create policy. Choose JSON or Visual editor. Example JSON for denying S3 deletion: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Action\": \"s3:DeleteBucket\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] }\r‚úÖ AWS Organizations and SCP (Service Control Policies) AWS Organizations helps you centrally manage multiple AWS accounts SCPs are used to set permission guardrails across accounts in the organization SCPs do not grant permissions, they limit permissions that IAM roles or users can have ‚úÖ Using SCPs Navigate AWS Organizations ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Create Policy Define allowed or denied actions using JSON, e.g.: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Action\": \"s3:DeleteBucket\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] }\rTag Policies Assignmnets: ‚úÖ 10 Tasks Related to AWS IAM Users These tasks are commonly performed when managing IAM Users in AWS.\n1. Create a new IAM user Add a user with a name and specify programmatic or console access. 2. Assign permissions to a user Attach managed or inline policies to grant necessary permissions. 3. Add a user to a group Place users into groups to inherit shared permissions. 4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Secure the user‚Äôs AWS account by enabling MFA. 5. Generate access keys for the user Create programmatic access credentials for CLI or SDK use. 6. Rotate the user‚Äôs access keys Replace old keys with new ones to enhance security. 7. Set password policies Enforce password length, complexity, and expiration rules for users. 8. Attach policies using least privilege principle Grant only required permissions rather than full access. 9. Monitor user activity Use AWS CloudTrail or IAM Access Analyzer to review actions performed by users. 10. Remove unused or inactive users Identify and delete users that are no longer required or inactive.",
