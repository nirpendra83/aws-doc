      <description>This guide introduces the foundational concepts of AWS, including AWS Account, Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), Edge Locations, and Support. Understanding these will help you navigate AWSâ€™s global infrastructure confidently.&#xA;AWS Account Your AWS Account is your unique identity in the AWS ecosystem. It acts as a container for your resources, billing, and permissions.&#xA;Manages access to AWS services Tracks usage and billing Supports multiple users via IAM (Identity and Access Management) Can be organized into Organizations for managing multiple accounts AWS Regions An AWS Region is a geographically distinct area containing multiple data centers.</description>

      <description>ðŸ“š AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.&#xA;âœ… What is AWS IAM? AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to:&#xA;Manage users and their permissions to access AWS resources. Grant fine-grained access using policies. Enhance security by applying best practices like least privilege and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Control authentication and authorization across accounts and services. âœ… Key Components of IAM 1. Users Represents individual people or services accessing AWS. Each user can have their own credentials (password, access keys). 2. Groups A collection of IAM users. Apply permissions collectively rather than individually. 3. Roles Assign permissions to AWS resources without creating long-term credentials. Used by applications, services, or federated users. 4. Policies JSON documents that define permissions. Specify allowed or denied actions, resources, and conditions. âœ… IAM Policies Example of a simple policy: { &#34;Version&#34;: &#34;2012-10-17&#34;, &#34;Statement&#34;: [ { &#34;Effect&#34;: &#34;Allow&#34;, &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;s3:ListBucket&#34;, &#34;Resource&#34;: &#34;arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket&#34; } ] }&#xD;Assignmnets: âœ… 10 Tasks Related to AWS IAM Users These tasks are commonly performed when managing IAM Users in AWS.</description>
